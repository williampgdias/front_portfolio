                    Our chef William started his adventure when he went to Dublin-Ireland in 2013 to study English. He started his journey in the kitchen in 2015 washing dishes, but always looking into the prep kitchen dreaming doing that for life. When he started as kitchen assistant, 3 months later, he saw something completely different. His life was really hard professionally, when many different thoughts happened. He started to change his mind and what he was doing in the planet.
